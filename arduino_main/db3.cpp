/* IMPORTANT NOTE: 
When this daughterboard was first designed, we tried to use this digital potentiometer:
https://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/x9c1/x9c102-103-104-503.pdf

However, when testing, we found that this pot was extremely unstable and difficult to control.
So, we switched to using this digital pot:
http://datasheet.octopart.com/AD5171BRJZ10-R2-Analog-Devices-datasheet-8546.pdf

The new digital pot has its pins located in different places than the old one.
In addition, the new digital pot requires two pull-up resistors and a filtering capacitor.
To accommodate these changes, we made a tiny breakout board for the new pot that
re-routed the pin connections and included the two resistors and the capacitor.

When testing the new pot on its own, we found it was very stable and easy to control
using code from this Arduino tutorial:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPotentiometer

However, we ran into problems when we tried to connect this digital pot to the daughterboard.
To control I2C devices with Arduino's built-in I2C hardware, you must use specific pins. 
Since this board was not originally designed with those pins in mind, we need to use a
software I2C library that allows I2C communication on other pins through bit-banging. 

The Arduino Software I2C library (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SoftwareI2CLibrary)
can only control one I2C device. To control multiple devices, you need a different library.
Arduino does not provide one, so we have been using this library from a hobbyist: 
https://todbot.com/blog/2010/09/25/softi2cmaster-add-i2c-to-any-arduino-pins/

However, we found that we are not able to control the digital potentiometers with this
library in the way we expected. Probing with the oscilloscope showed that the bits sent
by the original Arduino SoftwareI2CLibrary were not the same as the bits sent by Todbot's
SoftwareI2CLibrary. We are not certain of the cause of this difference.

We leave it to future teams to research this problem and find the solution. In the meantime,
this board can operate in current mirror mode only, by using the original Arduino 
SoftwareI2CLibrary to control just one digital potentiometer. However, this will require
changes to this file. Good luck!
